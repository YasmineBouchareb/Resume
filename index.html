I also had the occasion to be involved in different fields such as Dance, Economy, Finance, Management, Investment and Digital fields which developed in me a hunger of knowledge and advancement.  </p>

          <h3>Amazon Project Management Academyn (PMA)</h3>
          <p>On December 2020, I have been selected as a Project Manager for Amazon. My project was the Onboarding of new Amazon Business customers. </p>
          <p> The purpose of PMA is to find employees who want to dedicate time to understand deeply the internal and external system of Amazon by doing research, as well as taking regular trainings in order to develop project management skills. Each selected employee becomes a project manager with a specific project to construct and execute from scratch.</p>
          <p>After months of research, the solution I provided was the digitalization and improvement of the customer service and website with the creation of a Chatbot. </p>
